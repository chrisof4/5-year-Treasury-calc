5 Year Treasury Calculator

The most basic goal of this project is to collect a fractional 5 year treasury price from the user and convert it into the decimal equivilent. (e.g. 115'16.0 = 115.5). The input needs to be validated that it conforms to traditional fractional pricing (whole number + <apostrophe> + 32nds + <decimal> + quarter of 32nds expressed as 0,2,5, or 7). The decimal version will be displayed for the user.

More advanced versions of this project might allow the user to input an entry price and an exit price, and then calculate several items such as:
  - The risk in dollars
  - 1:1, 2:1, 3:1 price targets
  - The activation rule for confirmation entries
  - Display all of these values side by side in both fractional and decimal pricing.
