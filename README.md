5 Year Treasury Calculator

The most basic goal of this project is to collect a fractional 5 year treasury price from the user and convert it into the decimal equivilent. (e.g. 115'16.0 = 115.5). The input needs to be validated that it conforms to traditional fractional pricing (whole number + <apostrophe> + 32nds + <decimal> + quarter of 32nds expressed as 0,2,5, or 7). The decimal version will be displayed for the user.

The current version of this project collects an entry price and an exit price, then calculates several price targets (1:1, 2:1, 3:1, 4:1, and 5:1), and the activation rule for confirmation entries (identified as the confirmation price in the script). The output is displayed in table format in both fractional and decimal pricing.

Future versions may include such things as:
  - The risk in dollars
  - Profit and risk expressed in dollars
